# HI , I'm Brunda R Gowda :
I'm  a 3rd-year Engineering student and an AI & Machine Learning Developer passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and human-aligned systems. My work sits at the intersection of deep learning, generative AI, and intelligent automation, where I focus on transforming complex data into actionable, interpretable solutions.

I focus on building end-to-end AI and machine learning workflows, starting from data preprocessing and model development to basic model interpretation and deployment. I use FastAPI, Flask, and Streamlit to create simple, functional applications that demonstrate real-world use cases.

I balance theoretical learning with practical implementation, aiming to build models that are not only accurate but also understandable, reliable, and useful in practice, while continuously improving my skills through projects and experimentation.

Building AI that doesn’t just perform — but understands, learns, and evolves.
