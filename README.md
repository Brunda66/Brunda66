Hi, I’m Brunda R Gowda, a 3rd-year Engineering student and an AI & Machine Learning Developer passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and human-aligned systems. My work sits at the intersection of deep learning, generative AI, and intelligent automation, where I focus on transforming complex data into actionable, interpretable solutions.

I specialize in developing end-to-end AI pipelines — from model design and explainability using SHAP, LangChain, and LIME, to production-level deployment with FastAPI, Flask, and Streamlit. I combine research-driven thinking with practical engineering, ensuring that every model I build is not just accurate, but transparent, reliable, and impactful.

Driven by curiosity and guided by innovation, I continuously explore advancements in large language models, multimodal AI, and data-centric learning, with a long-term vision of contributing to ethical, adaptive, and scalable AI systems.

Building AI that doesn’t just perform — but understands, learns, and evolves.
